    Mayor Balen deletes controversial Facebook status
    KATHMANDU, Sep 4: Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) Mayor Balendra Shah (Balen) has deleted a controversial status he had posted on his Facebook wall on Saturday evening.

    On Saturday night, through Facebook, Mayor Shah warned to set Singha Durbar on fire after the traffic police stopped a vehicle of the KMC. He did not reveal who had stopped the vehicle and why.

    Similarly, after Shah received public criticism for making provocative statements, his secretariat issued a statement on Sunday and informed about the incident.

    The press statement issued by the mayorâ€™s secretariat mentioned that the police stopped the vehicle carrying Mayor Shah's wife Sabina Kafle, who gave birth a few days ago, and created unnecessary hassles and treated them like criminals.

    However, Balen deleted the controversial post on Monday morning."""
