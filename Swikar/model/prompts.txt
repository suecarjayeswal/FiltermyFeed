"""
Evaluate the semantic or contextual relevance of the given textString to the list of keywords provided. Please assess the relation deeply.

Text String:
{text_to_evaluate}
Keywords:
{keyword_list}

Calculate the original strength of the textString's relation to the keywords in scale 0 to 100.

Now, if original strength exceeds upper_strength_limit i.e {upper_thres} consider the scenario where we want to decrease the strength score to a new_strength that is below a lower_threshold i.e {lower_thres}. Remove words, phrases, or anything from the textString to achieve this while preserving the overall context to the extent possible.

Return a dictionary with the following information:
{{'original_strength': original_strength,
'list_of_words_removed': words_removed,
'new_strength': new_strength}}
